# TestingPatterns

This project is to record and share patterns and libraries that make testing 
- easier
- more resilient
- more powerful
- more descriptive

As a result, it also demonstrates many other patterns and libraries that enable good development practices. 

This project is very much overkill for a Todo list. However, the overkill is to demonstrate the patterns in a way that can easily be transfered to a large project
